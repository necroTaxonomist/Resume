I'm a recent graduate from Georgia Tech currently working at L3Harris Technologies in Sunrise, FL.
I've had experience in a lot of software engineering areas over most of my life,
but in recent years I've focused mainly on embedded software development.
At my current workplace, I work in embedded digital signal processing for software defined radios.
Seeking embedded developer positions with special interest in physical layer networking.
