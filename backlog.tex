\textit{Final design project for Processor Design with FPGAs}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item Used Verilog and an Altera DE2 FPGA board to create a five-stage pipelined processor from scratch, implementing a MIPS-like RISC architecture, with support for memory mapped I/O, with emented branch target prediction implemented using a small set-associative cash to map
    \item Created a general-purpose, user-configurable assembler to generate test code for the processor, with an adaptable interface capable of supporting a variety of user-defined assembly languages
\end{itemize}
